          There are many compelling reasons why Barack Obama, the 44th President
          of the United States, should be a playable character in the popular
          video game series Super Smash Bros. For one, Obama is a highly
          influential and historic figure who served as the first African
          American President of the United States. Including him as a playable
          character in the game would not only be a nod to his significance in
          American history, but it would also add diversity to the game's roster
          of characters.

          Additionally, Obama has a unique and memorable personal style that
          could make for an interesting and fun character in the game. His
          distinctive look, including his signature suits and his famous
          ear-to-ear grin, could be incorporated into his character design,
          making him instantly recognizable to players. Furthermore, his
          charisma and likability, which were key factors in his successful
          political career, could translate into an engaging and entertaining
          in-game persona.
